Misc
====
My first Github repo. Contains various just-for-fun projects.

artsy: series of Python functions for fancy text i/o effects.

name_compilation: I used to get annoyed whenever a friend gave me a mix cd, because I'd have to manually add
all the track names, artists, etc. iTunes only recognizes real albums. This program uses a service called 
echonest to identify unnamed tracks and retrieve all their metadata.
